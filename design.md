# TagDB (Name WIP)

## Plans
Image DB app, where images can be tagged, and have text written onto them.
 * Nested Tags
   * Tag Hierarchies
 * Image labelling

## TODO
 * [ ] Tag images via a TUI interface
   * [ ] REPL for commands / scripting
   * [ ] Image db structure
   * [ ] Project configuration (In progress)
   * [ ] Tags
 * [ ] Way to render an image with PIL modifications
 * [ ] Plugin System
   * [ ] Ideally, I'd like this app to exist as a base for plugins to do the real work.
